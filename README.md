### Description

A Quick & Easy Search routine for ListViews AND Recordsets -- hand in hand.

I find that a very nice pair-up in interface and behind the scenes action is the DAO set in conjunction with ListViews. To some this may already be apparent, to others perhaps not. <P><P>Copy this code in, using the correct DAO refs and the correct ListView, pass the three parameters in, and it should work like a charm. <P><P>Don't forget to vote for this code.

<P><P>Updated / Patched - 11/4/01 <P><P>Check out this screenshot ->
